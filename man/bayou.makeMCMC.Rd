  prior,
  samp = 10,

}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{a phylogenetic tree of class 'phylo'}

\item{dat}{a named vector of continuous trait values matching the tips in tree}

\item{pred}{A matrix or data frame with named columns with predictor data represented in the 
specified
formula}

\item{SE}{The standard error of the data. Either a single value applied to all the data, or a 
vector of length(dat).}

\item{model}{The parameterization of the OU model used. Either "OU" for standard parameterization 
with alpha and sigma^2; "OUrepar" for phylogenetic half-life and stationary variance (Vy), or 
"QG" for the Lande model, with parameters h^2 (heritability), P (phenotypic variance), omega^2 
(width of adaptive landscape), and Ne (effective population size)}

\item{prior}{A prior function of class 'priorFn' that gives the prior distribution of all 
parameters}

\item{samp}{The frequency at which Markov samples are retained}

\item{chunk}{The number of samples retained in memory before being written to a file}

\item{control}{A list providing a control object governing how often and which proposals are used}

\item{tuning}{A named vector that governs how liberal or conservative proposals are that equals 
the number of proposal mechanisms.}

\item{file.dir}{If a character string, then results are written to that working directory. If NULL, 
then results are not saved to files, but instead held in memory. Default is `tempdir()`, which
writes to an R temporary directory.}

\item{plot.freq}{How often plots should be made during the mcmc. If NULL, then plots are not 
produced}

\item{outname}{The prefix given to files created by the mcmc}

\item{plot.fn}{Function used in plotting, defaults to phytools::phenogram}

\item{ticker.freq}{How often a summary log should be printed to the screen}

\item{startpar}{A list with the starting parameters for the mcmc. If NULL, starting parameters 
are simulated from the prior distribution}

\item{moves}{A named list providing the proposal functions to be used in the mcmc. Names correspond
to the parameters to be modified in the parameter list. See 'details' for default values.}

\item{control.weights}{A named vector providing the relative frequency each proposal mechanism is 
to be used during the mcmc}

\item{lik.fn}{Likelihood function to be evaluated. Defaults to \code{bayou.lik}.}

\item{perform.checks}{A logical indicating whether to use bayou.checkModel to validate model inputs.}

\description{
Runs a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo on continuous phenotypic data 
on a phylogeny, sampling possible shift locations and 
shift magnitudes, and shift numbers.
}
\details{
By default, the alpha, sig2 (and various reparameterizations of these parameters) are adjusted 
with multiplier proposals, theta are adjusted with sliding window proposals,
and the number of shifts is adjusted by splitting and merging, as well as sliding the shifts 
both within and between branches. Allowed shift locations are specified by the 
prior function (see make.prior()).
