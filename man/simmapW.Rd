\title{Calculate the weight matrix of a set of regimes on a phylogeny}
\usage{
simmapW(tree, pars)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{either a tree of class "phylo" or a cache object produced by bayOU's internal 
functions. Must include list element 'maps' which is a simmap reconstruction of regime history.}

\item{pars}{a list of the parameters used to calculate the weight matrix. Only pars$alpha is
necessary to calculate the matrix, but others can be present.}
}
\description{
These functions calculate weight matrices from regimes specified in phytools' simmap format.
\code{simmapW} calculates the weight matrix for a set of regimes from a phylogeny
with a stored regime history. \code{.simmap.W} calculates the same matrix, but without checks and is 
generally run internally.
}
\details{
\code{.simmap.W} is more computationally efficient within a mcmc and is used internally. The value
of \code{TotExp} is supplied to speed computation and reduce redundancy, and cache objects must be supplied as
the phylogeny, and the parameter \code{ntheta} must be present in the list \code{pars}.
