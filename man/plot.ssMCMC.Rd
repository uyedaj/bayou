\usage{
\method{plot}{ssMCMC}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An 'ssMCMC' object}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{plot}}
}
\value{
No return value, called for side effects. This function generates
diagnostic plots for an `ssMCMC` object, including log-likelihood, log-prior,
log-reference function, and cumulative marginal likelihood across power posteriors.
}
\description{
S3 method for plotting ssMCMC objects
}
\details{
Produces 4 plots. The first 3 plot the prior, reference function and likelihood. Different colors
indicate different power posteriors for each. These chains should appear to be well mixed. The final plot
shows the sum of the marginal likelihood across each of the steps in the stepping stone algorithm.
