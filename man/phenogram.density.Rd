\title{Plot a pheongram with the posterior density for optima values}
\usage{
phenogram.density(
  tree,
  dat,
  burnin = 0,
  chain,
  colors = NULL,
  pp.cutoff = NULL,
  K = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogeny of class 'phylo'}

\item{dat}{A named vector of tip data}

\item{burnin}{The initial proportion of the MCMC to be discarded}

\item{chain}{A bayouMCMC object that contains the results of an MCMC chain}

\item{colors}{An optional named vector of colors to assign to regimes, \code{NULL} results in no regimes being plotted.}

\item{pp.cutoff}{The posterior probability cutoff value. Branches with posterior probabilities of having a shift above this value
will have the average location of the regime shift painted onto the branches.}

\item{K}{A list with the values of K to be plotted. If \code{NULL} all values of K are combined and a total posterior produced. This 
allows separate lines to be plotted for different numbers of shifts so that the location of optima can be compared, for example, between 
all samples that have 1 vs. 2 shifts in the posterior.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to \code{phenogram(...)}}
